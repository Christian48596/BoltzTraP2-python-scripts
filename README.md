## Script Overview

The script provided (BTP2-extract.py) is designed to process BoltzTraP2 output files (*.trace), perform unit conversions, adjust the chemical potential by subtracting the Fermi energy, and generate various plots for data analysis.

Key Functionalities:
	•	Load and Process Data: Reads the input data file and processes it into a usable format.
	•	Unit Conversion: Automatically detects and converts the unit of Ef (Rydberg, Hartree, or eV) to eV.
	•	Fermi Energy Adjustment: Optionally subtracts the provided Fermi energy from the chemical potential.
	•	Data Conversion: Converts the Seebeck coefficient from V/K to µV/K.
	•	Plot Generation: Offers multiple plotting options to visualize different physical properties.

## Running the Script

**Command-Line Arguments**

The script accepts the following command-line argument:
	•	-i, --input: (Required) Path to the input .trace file containing the data.

Example:

```
python BTP2-extract.py -i results.trace
```

**Interactive Prompts**

After executing the script with the required input file, you will be guided through a series of interactive prompts:

1. **Contact Information Display**:
  The script begins by displaying the contact information of Dr. Christian Tantardini.

2. **Fermi Energy Subtraction**:
	•	Prompt: Do you want to subtract the Fermi energy from μ? (yes/no)
	•	Action: If you choose yes, you will be prompted to enter the Fermi energy value in eV.

3. **Plotting Options**:
  You will be presented with a menu to select the type of plot you wish to generate:

Select a plotting option:
1. Plot S vs (μ - E_F) for chosen T(s) and save .csv file.
2. Plot S vs T for chosen (μ - E_F) value(s) and save .csv file.
3. Plot σ/τ₀ vs T for chosen (μ - E_F) value(s) and save .csv file.
4. Plot κₑ/τ₀ vs T for chosen (μ - E_F) value(s) and save .csv file.
5. Exit.

	•	Input: Enter the number corresponding to your choice (1-5).

4. **Additional Inputs Based on Plot Selection**:
	•	Option 1:
	•	Prompt: Enter temperature(s) in K separated by commas (e.g., 300,400,500)
	•	Options 2-4:
	•	Prompt: Enter (μ - E_F) value(s) in eV separated by commas (e.g., 1.000,2.000,3.000)
After entering the required values, the script will generate the corresponding plots and save the data used for plotting as .csv files in the plots directory.

5. **Continuation Prompt**:
After completing an action, you will be asked whether you want to perform another action:
	•	Prompt: Do you want to perform another action? (yes/no)
	•	Action: If yes, the plotting menu will be displayed again. If no, the script will exit.

Exiting the Script

At any point, you can choose to exit the script by selecting the appropriate option from the menu or by declining to perform another action when prompted.

## Functionalities

1. **Unit Conversion**
	•	Automatic Detection: The script reads the header of the input file to detect the unit of Ef. Supported units are Rydberg (Ry), Hartree (Ha), and electron volts (eV).
	•	Conversion to eV: If Ef is not in eV, it is converted using the following factors:
	•	1 Rydberg (Ry) = 13.605698 eV
	•	1 Hartree (Ha) = 27.211386 eV

2. **Fermi Energy Adjustment**
	•	Optional Subtraction: Users can choose to subtract a specified Fermi energy value from the chemical potential (μ). This is useful for aligning the chemical potential with the Fermi level in your analysis.

3. **Plotting Options**

The script offers four plotting options:

**Option 1: Seebeck Coefficient vs. (μ - E_F)**
	•	Description: Plots the Seebeck coefficient (S) against the adjusted chemical potential (μ - E_F) for selected temperatures.
	•	Inputs Required:
	•	Temperature(s) in Kelvin (K).
	•	Output:
	•	Plot image files (.png and .pdf) saved in the plots directory.
	•	Corresponding data used for plotting saved as .csv files.

**Option 2: Seebeck Coefficient vs. Temperature**
	•	Description: Plots the Seebeck coefficient (S) against temperature (T) for selected (μ - E_F) values.
	•	Inputs Required:
	•	(μ - E_F) value(s) in electron volts (eV).
	•	Output:
	•	Plot image files (.png and .pdf) saved in the plots directory.
	•	Corresponding data used for plotting saved as .csv files.

**Option 3: Electrical Conductivity vs. Temperature**
	•	Description: Plots the electrical conductivity (σ/τ₀) against temperature (T) for selected (μ - E_F) values.
	•	Inputs Required:
	•	(μ - E_F) value(s) in electron volts (eV).
	•	Output:
	•	Plot image files (.png and .pdf) saved in the plots directory.
	•	Corresponding data used for plotting saved as .csv files.

**Option 4: Electronic Thermal Conductivity vs. Temperature**
	•	Description: Plots the electronic thermal conductivity (κₑ/τ₀) against temperature (T) for selected (μ - E_F) values.
	•	Inputs Required:
	•	(μ - E_F) value(s) in electron volts (eV).
	•	Output:
	•	Plot image files (.png and .pdf) saved in the plots directory.
	•	Corresponding data used for plotting saved as .csv files.

## Output
  • Plots Directory: All generated plots and corresponding .csv data files are saved in the plots directory within the script’s root folder.
  • Plot Files: Each plot is saved in both .png and .pdf formats for versatility in usage.
  • CSV Files: The data used for each plot is saved as a .csv file, allowing for further analysis or record-keeping.

## Examples

**Example 2: Advanced Usage with Fermi Energy Subtraction**

Process a .trace file, subtract a Fermi energy of 5.0 eV, and generate multiple plots.

python BTP2-extract.py -i results.trace

*Interactive Steps*:
	1.	Fermi Energy Subtraction:
	•	Input: yes
	•	Fermi Energy Value: 5.0
	2.	Select Plotting Option:
	•	Input: 1
	3.	Enter Temperature Values:
	•	Input: 300,400,500

	•	Saves corresponding .csv data files for each plot.

## Troubleshooting

  •	Missing Dependencies:
	•	Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
	•	Solution: Install the missing package using pip install pandas.
	•	Invalid Input File:
	•	Error: Error loading data: [Error Details]
	•	Solution: Ensure the input file path is correct and the file is formatted as expected.
	•	No Data Found for Selected Parameters:
	•	Warning: Warning: No data found for T = 600 K.
	•	Solution: Verify that the entered temperature or (μ - E_F) values exist in the dataset.
	•	Unit Detection Failure:
	•	Message: Ef unit not specified in the header. Assuming 'Ef[eV]'.
	•	Solution: Ensure that the input file header includes the unit of Ef. If not, the script defaults to eV.
	•	Plot Not Generated:
	•	Message: No plots were generated for S vs μ - E_F due to missing data.
	•	Solution: Check the entered parameters and ensure they match the data within the specified tolerance.
